Trusty and well-beloved we greet you well.

E being greatly defirous to favour and encourage our two
univeriities those ancient and laudable nurseries of piety
and learning and to enable thern more effeetually to answer the
end of their institution by sending forth constant supplies of learn-
ed and 'able men to serve the publick both in church and state
and having observed that no encouragement or provifion has hi*-
thereto been made in either of the said univerfities for the study
of modern history or rnodern languages the knowledge of which
iz highly necessary towards compleatly qualifying the youth com-
mitted to their care for several stations both in church and state
to which they may be called and having serioussy weighed the
prejudice that has accrued to the said univerfities from this defo&
persons of foreign natIons being often employed in the educatiou
and tuition of youth both at home and in their travels and great
numbers of the young nobility and genti-y being either sent abroad
> direffly from school or taken away from the univerlities before
the course of their studies can be there compleatod and opportu-
nities frequently lost to the crown of employing and encouraging
members of the two univerfities by conferring on them such em-
ployments both at home and ahroad as necesshrlly require a com-
petent ssdll in writing and speaking the modern language«

In order therefore to remedy these and the like inconveniences
we have determined to appoint two persons of sober conversation
and prudent condue‘t of the degree of master of arte or bacheler
of laws or of some higher degoee in one of the said univerfitiee
{killed in modern history and in the knowledge of modern lan-
guages to be nominated by us to be our profeffors of modern
history one for the univerfity of Cambridge and the other for that
of Oxford who [hall be obliged to read lestures in the publick
schoole at such timee as [hall hereafter be appointed. And we have
further determined that each of the said professors lhall have a
stipend of four hundred pounds pet annum and out of the said
stipend [hall be obliged to maintain with sufficient salaries in the
uuwerfiry where he [hall be establilhed two persons at least well

qualified
