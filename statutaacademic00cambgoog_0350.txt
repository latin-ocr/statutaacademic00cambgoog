under the same penalties to perform the same on the next usual
day for such exercise and so from time to time till he shall have
afilually performed it or else be excused upon just and necess'ary
cause fo be allowed and approved of by the vice-chancellor the
senior prostor for the time being and the master of the college to
which' such person doth belong: which method of proeeediug we
will have alib to take place and be duly observed as to the exercise
of oppofing' m those schools saving that the punishment for the

above direE'ted. And so we bid you farewell.
